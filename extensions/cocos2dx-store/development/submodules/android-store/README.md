*SOOMLA's Store Module for Android*

**December 3rd, 2014**:
Migrating Amazon IAP from v1.0 to v2.0. [Read more about IAP v2.0](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing/docs-v2/migrate-iapv1-apps-to-iapv2)

**September 15th, 2014**:
`NonConsumableItem` class was removed.
To create a non-consumable item in your `IStoreAssetes` implementation, use `LifeTimeVG` with `PurchaseType` of `PurchaseWithMarket`.

The current virtual economy model is called **modelV3**. Want to learn more about it? Try these:

## Download

#### Pre baked jars:

- [android-store v3.6.21](http://library.soom.la/fetch/android-store/3.6.21?cf=github)

#### From sources:
 - Clone this repository recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/soomla/android-store.git`;
 - Run `./build_all` from project directory;
 - Take created binaries from `build` directory and use it!

## Getting Started

* Before doing anything, SOOMLA recommends that you go through [Android In-app Billing](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/index.html) or [Amazon In App Purchasing](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing) according to the billing service provider you choose.

1. First, you'll need to either add the jars from the build folder to your project (RECOMMENDED), or clone android-store.

  - RECOMMENDED: Add the jars from the [build](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/tree/master/build) folder to your project.

    OR, if you'd like to work with sources:

  - Recursively clone android-store.

    ```
    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/android-store.git
    ```

    > There are some necessary files in submodules linked with symbolic links. If you're cloning the project make sure to include the `--recursive` flag.

2. Make the following changes to your AndroidManifest.xml:

    Set `SoomlaApp` as the main Application by placing it in the `application` tag:

    ``` xml
    <application ...
        android:name="com.soomla.SoomlaApp">
    ```

3. Initialize Soomla with a secret that you chose to encrypt the user data. (For those who came from older versions, this should be the same as the old "customSec"):

    ``` java
    Soomla.initialize("[YOUR CUSTOM GAME SECRET HERE]");
    ```

    > This secret is your encryption secret for data saved in the DB.

4. Create your own implementation of `IStoreAssets` in order to describe your game's specific assets.
  - See the brief [example](#example) at the bottom.
  - See a more detailed example, our MuffinRush [example](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/MuffinRushAssets.java).

5. Initialize `SoomlaStore` with the class you just created:

    ``` java
    SoomlaStore.getInstance().initialize(new YourStoreAssetsImplementation());
    ```

    > Initialize `SoomlaStore` ONLY ONCE when your application loads.

And that's it! You have storage and in-app purchasing capabilities... ALL-IN-ONE.

Refer to the next section for information on selecting your Billing Service provider and setting it up.

## Selecting a Billing Service

SOOMLA's android-store can be used on all Android based devices meaning that you might want to use IAP with different billing services.

We've created two billing services for you: Google Play and Amazon (according to your demand).

The billing service is automatically started and stopped for every operation you're running on `SoomlaStore` (`buyWithMarket`, `restoreTransactions`, etc...).

Be careful with that. Don't leave the service running in the background without closing it.

You must select a billing service for android-store to work properly. The integration of a billing service is very easy:

### [Google Play](https://github.com/soomla/android-store-google-play)

Once you complete the following steps, see the [Google Play IAB](http://know.soom.la/android/store/store_googleplayiab/)
tutorial in our _Knowledge Base_ for information about in-app-purchase setup, integration with SOOMLA, and how to define your in-app
purchase items.

1. Add `AndroidStoreGooglePlay.jar` from the folder `billing-services/google-play` to your project.

2. Make the following changes in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

  Add the following permission (for Google Play):

  ``` xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
  ```

  Add the `IabActivity` to your `application` element, the plugin will spawn a transparent activity to make purchases. Also, you need to tell us what plugin you're using so add a meta-data tag for that:

  ``` xml
  <activity android:name="com.soomla.store.billing.google.GooglePlayIabService$IabActivity"
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"/>
  <meta-data android:name="billing.service" android:value="google.GooglePlayIabService" />
  ```

3. After you initialize `SoomlaStore`, let the plugin know your public key from [Google play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/):

  ``` java
  public class StoreExampleActivity extends Activity {
      ...
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          ...
          GooglePlayIabService.getInstance().setPublicKey("[YOUR PUBLIC KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY]");
      }
  }
  ```

4. If you want to allow Android's test purchases, all you need to do is tell that to the plugin:

  ``` java
  public class StoreExampleActivity extends Activity {
      ...
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          ...
          GooglePlayIabService.AllowAndroidTestPurchases = true;
      }
  }
  ```

5. In case you want to turn on _Fraud Protection_ you need to get clientId, clientSecret and refreshToken as
explained in [Google Play Purchase Verification](http://know.soom.la/android/store/Store_GooglePlayVerification) in
our _Knowledge Base_ and use them like this:

  ``` java
      GooglePlayIabService.getInstance().configVerifyPurchases(new HashMap<String, Object>() {{
          put("clientId", <YOU_CLIENT_ID>);
          put("clientSecret", <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>);
          put("refreshToken", <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>);
      }});
  ```

  >  Optionally you can turn on `verifyOnServerFailure` if you want to get purchases automatically verified in case of network failures during the verification process:
  >
  > ``` java
  > GooglePlayIabService.getInstance().configVerifyPurchases(new HashMap<String, Object>() {{
  >     put("clientId", <YOU_CLIENT_ID>);
  >     put("clientSecret", <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>);
  >     put("refreshToken", <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>);
  >     put("verifyOnServerFailure", true);
  > }});
  > ```

####**If you have an in-game storefront**

We recommend that you open the IAB Service and keep it open in the background. This how to do that:

When you open the store, call:  
``` java
SoomlaStore.getInstance().startIabServiceInBg();
```

When the store is closed, call:  
``` java
SoomlaStore.getInstance().stopIabServiceInBg();
```

#### [Amazon](https://github.com/soomla/android-store-amazon)

Once you complete the following steps, see the [Amazon IAB](http://know.soom.la/android/store/Store_AmazonIAB) tutorial
in our _Knowledge Base_ for information about in-app-purchase setup, integration with SOOMLA, and how to define your
in-app purchase items.

1. Add `in-app-purchasing-2.0.1.jar` and `AndroidStoreAmazon.jar` from the folder `billing-services/amazon` to your project.

2. Make the following changes in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

  Add Amazon's `ResponseReceiver` to your `application` element. Also, you need to tell us what plugin you're using so add a meta-data tag for that:

  ``` xml
  <receiver android:name = "com.amazon.inapp.purchasing.ResponseReceiver" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name = "com.amazon.inapp.purchasing.NOTIFY"
            android:permission = "com.amazon.inapp.purchasing.Permission.NOTIFY" />
    </intent-filter>
  </receiver>
  <meta-data android:name="billing.service" android:value="amazon.AmazonIabService" />
  ```

## Important read: In App Purchasing.


When we implemented modelV3, we were thinking about ways people buy things inside apps. We figured many ways you can let your users purchase stuff in your game and we designed the new modelV3 to support 2 of them: PurchaseWithMarket and PurchaseWithVirtualItem.

**PurchaseWithMarket** is a PurchaseType that allows users to purchase a VirtualItem with Google Play.  
**PurchaseWithVirtualItem** is a PurchaseType that lets your users purchase a VirtualItem with a different VirtualItem. For Example: Buying 1 Sword with 100 Gems.

In order to define the way your various virtual items (Goods, Coins ...) are purchased, you'll need to create your implementation of IStoreAsset (the same one from step 4 in the "Getting Started" above).

Here is an example:

Lets say you have a _VirtualCurrencyPack_ you call `TEN_COINS_PACK` and a _VirtualCurrency_ you call `COIN_CURRENCY`:

```Java
VirtualCurrencyPack TEN_COINS_PACK = new VirtualCurrencyPack(
        "10 Coins",                                     // name
        "A pack of 10 coins",                           // description
        "10_coins",                                     // item id
        10,                                             // number of currencies in the pack
        COIN_CURRENCY_ITEM_ID,                          // the currency associated with this pack
        new PurchaseWithMarket("com.soomla.ten_coin_pack", 1.99));
```

Now you can use _StoreInventory_ to buy your new VirtualCurrencyPack:

```Java
StoreInventory.buy(TEN_COINS_PACK.getItemId(), null);
```

And that's it! android-store knows how to contact Google Play for you and will redirect your users to their purchasing system to complete the transaction.
Don't forget to define your _IStoreEventHandler_ in order to get the events of successful or failed purchases (see [Event Handling](https://github.com/soomla/android-store#event-handling)).


## Debugging

In order to debug android-store, set `SoomlaConfig.logDebug` to `true`. This will print all of _android-store's_ debugging messages to logcat.

## Storage & Meta-Data


When you initialize _SoomlaStore_, it automatically initializes two other classes: _StorageManager_ and _StoreInfo_. _StorageManager_ is the father of all storage related instances in your game. Use it to access the balances of virtual currencies and virtual goods (usually, using their itemIds). _StoreInfo_ is the mother of all meta data information about your specific game. It is initialized with your implementation of `IStoreAssets` and you can use it to retrieve information about your specific game.  
We've also added _StoreInventory_ which is a utility class to help you do store related operations even easier.

The on-device storage is encrypted and kept in a SQLite database. SOOMLA is preparing a cloud-based storage service that will allow this SQLite to be synced to a cloud-based repository that you'll define.

**Example Usages**

* Give the user 10 pieces of a virtual currency with itemId "currency_coin":

    ```Java
    StoreInventory.giveVirtualItem("currency_coin", 10);
    ```

* Take 10 virtual goods with itemId "green_hat":

    ```Java
    StoreInventory.takeVirtualItem("green_hat", 10);
    ```

* Get the current balance of a virtual good with itemId "green_hat" (here we decided to show you the 'long' way. you can also use StoreInventory):

    ```Java
    VirtualGood greenHat = (VirtualGood)StoreInfo.getVirtualItem("green_hat");
    int greenHatsBalance = StorageManager.getVirtualGoodsStorage().getBalance(greenHat);
    ```

## Security


If you want to protect your game from 'bad people' (and who doesn't?!), you might want to follow some guidelines:

+ SOOMLA keeps the game's data in an encrypted database. In order to encrypt your data, SOOMLA generates a private key out of several parts of information. The Soomla Secret (before v3.4.1 is was called customSec) is one of them. SOOMLA recommends that you provide this value when initializing `SoomlaStore` and before you release your game. BE CAREFUL: You can change this value once! If you try to change it again, old data from the database will become unavailable.
+ Following Google's recommendation, SOOMLA also recommends that you split your public key and construct it on runtime or even use bit manipulation on it in order to hide it. The key itself is not secret information but if someone replaces it, your application might get fake messages that might harm it.

## Event Handling


For event handling, we use Square's great open-source project [otto](http://square.github.com/otto/). In ordered to be notified of store related events, you can register for specific events and create your game-specific behavior to handle them.

> Your behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.

In order to register for events:

1. In the class that should receive the event create a function with the annotation '@Subscribe'. Example:

    ```Java
    @Subscribe
    public void onMarketPurchaseEvent(MarketPurchaseEvent marketPurchaseEvent) {
        ...
    }
    ```

2. You'll also have to register your class in the event bus (and unregister when needed):

   ```Java
   BusProvider.getInstance().register(this);
   ```

   ```Java
   BusProvider.getInstance().unregister(this);
   ```

> If your class is an Activity, register in 'onResume' and unregister in 'onPause'

You can find a full event handler example [here](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/ExampleEventHandler.java).

[List of events](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/tree/master/SoomlaAndroidStore/src/com/soomla/store/events)

[Full documentation and explanation of otto](http://square.github.com/otto/)

##Example

Create your own implementation of `IStoreAssets`; See the article about [IStoreAssets](http://know.soom.la/android/store/Store_IStoreAssets) in our _Knowledge Base_, which includes a code example and explanations.

Then initialize `SoomlaStore` with your implementation of `IStoreAssets`:

``` java
public class StoreExampleActivity extends Activity {
    ...

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...

        IStoreAssets storeAssets = new YourImplementationAssets();

        // This value is a secret of your choice.
        // You can't change it after you publish your game.
        Soomla.initialize("[CUSTOM SECRET HERE]");
        SoomlaStore.getInstance().initialize(storeAssets);

        /** The following are relevant only if your Billing Provider is Google Play **/

        // When you create your app in Google play Developer Console,
        // you'll find this key under the "Services & APIs" tab.
        GooglePlayIabService.getInstance().setPublicKey("[YOUR PUBLIC KEY FROM THE MARKET]");
        GooglePlayIabService.AllowAndroidTestPurchases = true;
        ...
    }

    ...
}
```
